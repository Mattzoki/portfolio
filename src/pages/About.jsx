      <p>
        I’m an NLP researcher and former Senior Frontend Developer with
        experience across natural language processing, machine learning, and
        full‑stack development. I’ve built performant web apps (React, Angular,
        Node, OpenLayers) and research prototypes with transformer models.

        I enjoy problems where I can move from data and modeling → to product UX
        and delivery. Lately: generalisation in NER, negation scope, and emotion
        detection; plus building clean, robust UI for AI systems.
